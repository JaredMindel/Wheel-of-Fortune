				Show the consonants in that word alongside all characters that have already been guessed 
				Add the amount of money from the wheel segment * the number of instances of that letter
				let them buy a vowel if they want (give them the guess word option too):
					if they don't, move on
					if they do, remove $250 from their bank
					repeat until any of the following occurs (give them the word guess option):
						they run out of money
						the vowel they guess doesn't appear
						they don't want to guess anymore
