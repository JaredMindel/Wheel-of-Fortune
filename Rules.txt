Player's Gameplay:
	Spin wheel:
		If the wheel selection is "Lose a Turn," end the turn
		If the wheel selection is "BANKRUPT," reset the player's bank to 0 and end their turn
		If the wheel selection is a dollar value, they can guess a consonant
		If they correctly guess a consonant, they have the opportunity to buy vowels
		Vowels take money out of the player's bank
		If the player can still play, they may guess a word; otherwise, end their turn
	Final Round
		1 final round with the person with the highest bank
		final round starts with R-S-T-L-N-E revealed
		player can pick 3 more consonants and 1 more vowel
		the final round should have a timer of 5 or more seconds for the player to guess that answer
		if they get it right, show them the cash prize
	The Wheel (24 segments)
		One segment is labeled "BANKRUPT"
		Many segments have cash values round to the $50 between $100 - $900
		One segment is labeled "Lose a Turn" which causes the player's turn to end 
		Each player spins the wheel as part of their turn to determine how much they might make from a correct guess
